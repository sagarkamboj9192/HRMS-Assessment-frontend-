🏗 Project Structure & Approach

Built with reusable components to ensure maintainability and scalability.

Followed a proper project structure for better readability and separation of concerns.

Designed keeping future scalability in mind.

API Integration Strategy

For large-scale applications, Redux is preferred for better state management and cleaner API handling.

For this small assignment, APIs are integrated directly to save time, as deployment of both frontend and backend was also required.
